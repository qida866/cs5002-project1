CS 5002 Project 1 - Part 1

This repository contains my Python implementation for CS 5002 Project 1 Part 1.
The main code is written in project1.py.

The project focuses on implementing gradient descent for one-variable and
two-variable functions, performing parameter experiments, and exploring
numerical derivatives.

To run the code, simply execute project1.py using Python.
